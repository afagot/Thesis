	The PhD project I worked on for the past seven years is finally reaching an end. It's time to look back and thank all the people without whom it wouldn't have been possible. I thank Gabriella and Nicolas for giving me the opportunity to work on such an interesting project. It has been motivating working in a team with a lot of young researchers in the same situation as me. I mainly think of Andrea, François, Jan, Severiano and Shereen with whom I interacted the most when I was at CERN. Of course, the team also was mentored by great people with a lot of experience like Ian and Salvador with whom I got a lot of pleasure working.\\
	My interest in the R\&D project and my knowledge of detectors opened a few other doors. I got the trust from Anna and Gabriella to become expert-on-call for the RPC sub-system at CMS which was not an easy task but that brought me a lot of experience and confidence. I feel lucky that people such as Salvador and Isabel invited me at more than one occasion to go to Mexico to work with students there. This was very rewarding. Ultimately, I would like to thank my promotor Michael for giving me this chance and Imad for putting us in contact. Michael let me a lot of autonomy to take the PhD project in the direction I wanted and Imad has been a great Master Responsible back in Lyon. He knew his students well and knew where they could flourish.\\
	
	But of course, the completion of this PhD project is also greatly subjected to the social life I developed and the support from my family and friends. I could count on my parents, brother and cousins, Yoan and Laetitia, at any moment throughout these years. Special thanks to Laetitia and Thierry, but also to the kids, for hosting me each time I was at CERN. This was a huge moral help. CERN is a wonderful place to work, but the work load can be overwhelming. Childhood friends also did a lot. Clément and Lolita brought me some light by regularly visiting me. The bond with Mikael and Xavier never weakened even though we could not meet very often anymore.\\
	I wish to thank Nick. We managed to support each other and it turned out quite well in the end. Of course, I can't thank Nick without including Ibby. I wish she didn't leave Ghent so soon, we met a little too late. Our trio was quite fun. I was lucky to have great flatmates. I had first met Bryan in the kot we were sharing during our first year in Ghent. Very friendly and open minded. Paul, I knew already from Lyon but it turned out that he also applied for a PhD in Ghent and got it. It has been nice to share a place with you two. Of course, then came Nina that has been also very nice to live with. I remember nice parties at home and a lot of shared food.\\
	A big thanks to Mostafa and Abbas for the ones that have been here since the very beginning and to Dinka, Amélie and Joe to include me in there groups when I needed it. Jean-François, with his great mind, holds a very special place as he never stopped challenging me with sciences and other topics. It was always a great time meeting with him. Thanks to the ones I met without really expecting it but that naturally integrated me in their circle. Anthony, Charline, Dylan, Florian and Maurane, Guillaume, Roxane, Thomas, both of the Valentins, and Vincent. I probably got some of the most life changing conversations with them. My vision of the world really evolved at their contact. Finally, I would like to thank the people that made me want to build my life here. Alba and Andres, Carmen and Raul, Kajetan, Maren and Prem, Martina, Meta and Vishvas, Nils and Liesl, Ola, and of course Paula, who is sharing my life for a while now.\\
	
	To some of you, even if our paths are now separate, I don't forget what you brought me. I am thankful for that. To the rest of you that I have the pleasure on meeting often, you make of every day a good moment. I hope it goes on for as long as possible. Take care.
