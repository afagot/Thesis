{A data acquisition software for VME CAEN TDCs}
\label{app1}

Certifying detectors in the perspective of HL-LHC required to develop tools for the GIF++ experiment. One of them was the \acf{DAQ} software that allows to make the communications in between the computer and the TDC modules in order to retrieve the RPC data~\cite{GIFDAQ}. In this appendix, details about the software, as of how the software was written, how it functions and how it can be exported to another similar setup.

\section{Description of the setup}

	As previously described in Section~\ref{ssec:PulseProc}, CMS RPC FEEs provide us with \SI{100}{ns} long LVDS output signals. These signals are then sent into V1190A \acf{TDC} modules manufactured by CAEN~\cite{V1190AMUT}. V1190A are VME units accepting 128 independent Multi-Hit/Multi-Event TDC channels whose signals are treated by 4 \SI{100}{ps} high performance TDC chips, developped by CERN/ECP-MIC Division. The data acquisition used at GIF takes profit of the \textit{Trigger Matching Mode} offered by modules V1190A. A trigger matching is performed in between a trigger time tag and the channel time measurements. The signal provided by the co√Øncidence of both PMTs is used to trigger the data acquisition. Control over this data acquisition mode, explained through Figure~\ref{fig:V1190A-TMM} is offered through 4 programmable parameters:
        
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{match window:} the match between a trigger and a hit is done within a programmable time window
		\item \textbf{window offset:} temporal distance between the trigger tag and the start of the trigger matching window
		\item \textbf{extra search margin:} an extended time window is used to ensure that all matching hits are found
		\item \textbf{reject margin:} older hits are automatically rejected to preven buffer overflows and to speed up the search time
	\end{itemize}

	The communication between the computer ond the TDCs to transfer data is done via a V1718 VME master module operated from a USB port.
